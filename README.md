WoWQuiz
=======

This project is a simple World of Warcraft quiz for World of Warcraft fans. This is a simple 5 question quiz where users select the appropriate answer.
The most interesting parts about this project were creating the questions and the answers using gif images:

1) Firstly, I created an array of questions using javascript objects with some questions, descriptions, and option choices for answers
2) Then, I used the data attribute to label the correct answer choice and add that correct score to the overall score
3) I used jQuery ".data" function to grab the correct answer
